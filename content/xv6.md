Heyo, here's just a collection of stuff (in no particular order) that helped me out while I ~~was~~ am currently meddling with xv6 for my OS course.

1. [Tyler Allen's Intro to xv6](https://tnallen.people.clemson.edu/2019/03/04/intro-to-xv6.html)
2. [Yehuda Shapira's xv6-explained repo](https://github.com/YehudaShapira/xv6-explained)
