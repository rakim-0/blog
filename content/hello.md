Heyo, Welcome to the first post!  
I'll mostly use this place to blog about anything interesting be that tech or anime or interesting situations.


Trying out code blocks:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello!");
}
```
Not bad. Well this is all I wanted to test. Can't wait to start actually writing blogs!  
Massive thanks to the [team behind Zola](www.getzola.org) and [pawroman for the theme](https://github.com/pawroman/zola-theme-terminimal/)!

See ya then
